* Downloaded/installed VC++ Express 2010 http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP

SDK -- running Windows 7 64-bit on an Intel i7 ("AMD") so got the Windows 7 SDK from http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C17BA869-9671-4330-A63E-1FD44E0E2505&displaylang=en
 --- no "AMD" option, though.  So just got default.
 
MozillaBuild from the link, default location

ran start-msvc10.bat (for VC++ 2010, I assume)

It was in /c/Users/giles, which has no spaces so should be fine.
Ran the hg clone, cd
created mozconfig as per description (no parallel build, of course)

configure: error: System header atlbase.h is not available. See http://developer
.mozilla.org/en/docs/atlbase.h for details on fixing this problem.
*** Fix above errors and then restart with               "make -f client.mk buil
d"

http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/atlbase.h gives various potential fixes; quickest
looked like adding this to mozconfig: 

ac_add_options --disable-accessibility
